 /*Section 15 Challenge
 Inheritance

You are provided with a simple Account class hierarchy that contains
Account - Base class
Savings Account - Derived class

An Account has a name and a balance.
A Savings Account is an Account and adds an interest rate.

I have also provided some Account helper functions in Account_Util.h and Account_Util.cpp
that make it easy to display, deposit to, and withdraw from a vector of Accountsand Savings Accounts.

Please refer to the source code providedand the video explanation of this challenge for more details.

Your challenge is the following :

1. Add a Checking account class to the Account hierarchy
A Checking account has a name and a balance and has a fee of $1.50 per withdrawal transaction.
Every withdrawal transaction will be assessed this flat fee.

2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
A Trust account has a name, a balance, and an interest rate
The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.
However, any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.

The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20 % of the account balance.
You don't have to keep track of calendar time for this application, just make sure the 4th withdrawal fails :)

Hints:
Reuse existing functionality!!
Think about what the Base class will be for the new classes.
Add helper functions to Account_Util.hand Account_Util.cpp if you wish to work with your new classes.
(You don't have to, but it will make your main much easier to use)

    Have fun!!You are no longer beginner C++ programmers!

    If you want more practice with operator overloading you can overload += and -= for depositand withdrawal :)
